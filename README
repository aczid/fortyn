fortyn ("fourteen") is a simulator for the Freescale (formerly Motorola)
HC08 family (and possibly compatible families) of 8-bit
microcontrollers.

This project was undertaken as a hobby project, and was not designed to
fill a particular need. However, if you find it useful in any way, I
would be delighted to hear about it.

As a hobby project undertaken without planning, it has few design
principles besides a general desire to make the system modular,
minimal, and flexible. Heavy use was made of code generation (the
Makefile, coupled with the tools/make_opcode_table.pl script, will build
the ops.c and ops.h files from a PDF specification if they do not
exist), and framework remains in place for producing a list of
unimplemented operations and for defaulting to no operation for
unimplemented ops. This means it should be fairly easy to add extended
ISA support.

Several UIs exist, with each starting in ui/[name]/main.c. This
code represents my first experimentation with [n]curses, so please
do not take the (minimal) example there are a sample of excellent
curses coding.

The simulator has not yet been fully tested -- not all of its operations
have even been run. Eventually I would like to have a test suite or
another way to compare its behavior to that of a known-good simulator,
but I make no promises thereto.

The name "fortyn" is a corruption of "fourteen," which is the English
spelling of the concatenation of the digits 1 and 4, which can be
represented in Japanese by the sounds "ichi" and "shi," which sound
superficially like the letters H and C in English, which constitute part
of the name of the simulated family of microcontrollers.
