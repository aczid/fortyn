fortyn ("fourteen") is a simulator for the Freescale (formerly Motorola)
HC(S)08 family of 8-bit microcontrollers.

This project was undertaken as a hobby project, and was not designed to fill a
particular need. However, if you find it useful in any way, I would be
delighted to hear about it.

As a hobby project undertaken without planning, it has few design
principles besides a general desire to make the system modular,
minimal, and flexible.

Several (shells of) UIs exist, with each starting in ui/[name]/main.c. This
code represents my first experimentation with [n]curses, so please do not take
the (minimal) example there are a sample of excellent curses coding.

The simulator has not been rigorously tested. The test suite is growing but
small. I make no promises about the correctness of the simulation.

The name "fortyn" is a corruption of "fourteen," which is the English spelling
of the concatenation of the digits 1 and 4, which can be represented in
Japanese by the sounds "ichi" and "shi," which sound superficially like the
letters H and C in English, which constitute part of the name of the simulated
family of microcontrollers.
